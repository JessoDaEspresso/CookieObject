# CookieObject
An object oriented program where you order a Cookie. You can choose up to 3 of the toppings and you can decide if you want a scoop of icecream with it.

**Please note that this is not a professional program and there are errors, and it is not very well optimized. It was created more an a learning experience. I am making this public as the source code was written by me, and it was not for school.

The Program includes:

A BAT Script that is used to run the JAR File
The JAR File Itself
The Source Code
The Icon File
